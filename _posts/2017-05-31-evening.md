>   Therefore it is an excellent and fruitful custom of holy Church that
>   we should sing Mary’s hymn at the time of evening prayer. By
>   meditating upon the incarnation, our devotion is kindled, and by
>   remembering the example of God’s Mother, we are encouraged to lead a
>   life of virtue. Such virtues are best achieved in the evening. We
>   are weary after the day’s work and worn out by our distractions. The
>   time for rest is near, and our minds are ready for contemplation.

> -- from a sermon by St Bede the Venerable
