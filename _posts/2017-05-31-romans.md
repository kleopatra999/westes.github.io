> Do not let your love be a pretence, but sincerely prefer good to
> evil. Love each other as much as brothers should, and have a profound
> respect for each other. Work for the Lord with untiring effort and
> with great earnestness of spirit. If you have hope, this will make you
> cheerful. Do not give up if trials come; and keep on praying. If any
> of the saints are in need you must share with them; and you should
> make hospitality your special care.
> 
>   Bless those who persecute you: never curse them, bless them. Rejoice
>   with those who rejoice and be sad with those in sorrow. Treat
>   everyone with equal kindness; never be condescending but make real
>   friends with the poor.
> 
> -- Romans 12:9-16
